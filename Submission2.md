# Key Concepts in Blockchain Technologies

The purpose of this submission is to explore different blockchain platforms in order to understand the solutions available in the market today and, more importantly, to solidify your understanding of the key concepts of blockchains.

As a starting point to compare different blockchain technologies, use Module 5: Cryptocurrencies course notes as well as the notes below on settlement finality.

_Settlement Finality: Payments Perspective_

Much of the interest around blockchain, particularly Bitcoin, is its potential role as a payments system. As such, it is worth considering the concept of settlement finality for each of these technologies.

At a high-level, settlement finality refers to the concept of a payment being irrevocable – i.e. once a payment is made, and settled, it cannot be reversed. Interestingly, this is particularly important in the prevention of bank runs. Let’s consider a more relevant example around what settlement finality is by looking at Bitcoin.

Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work consensus algorithm, which relies on miners sorting transactions into blocks, and timestamping them. However, should 51% of the network choose to, it is possible to go back and re-mine the chain. As such, Bitcoin has a probabilistic settlement. Essentially, it is always theoretically possible that a payment can be reversed. (Of course, this possibility decreases significantly with chain length and the number of miners.)

See the following reference: https://www.mangoresearch.co/settlement-finality-pow-posblockchain/ for a more detailed explanation.

For this submission, your task is to describe and compare the key concepts of different blockchain technologies:

1. Bitcoin
2. Ethereum
3. Hyperledger
4. Corda

For each of the technologies above, discuss the following:

1. _Scalability_ – i.e. the ability for the system to process transactions.
2. _Consensus protocol_ – i.e. how the network reaches a state of consensus or how the integrity of the ledger is maintained.
3. _Privacy_ – i.e. the degree to which users and transactions are private.
4. _Degree of decentralization_ – i.e. whether there are central points of failure or authority.
5. _Settlement finality_ – i.e. whether transactions are truly final and irrevocable.

Write a report of 1-2 pages for each of the points above.
